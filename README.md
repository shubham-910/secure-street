üîç **Key Features:**

- **Crime Reporting**: Users can easily report crimes online, providing detailed information to authorities.
- **Facial Recognition**: Integrates AWS Rekognition to match suspect photos with criminal records.
- **Document Processing**: Utilizes AWS Textract to convert FIR document images into editable text formats.
- **Secure Storage**: Employs AWS S3 and KMS for encrypted object storage, ensuring data security.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Implements load balancing and autoscaling features for robust performance.

üõ† **Technologies Used:**

- AWS Lambda
- API Gateway
- Rekognition
- Textract
- S3
- CloudFormation

üîß **Architecture Overview:**

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, hosted on a public subnet EC2 instance.
- **Backend**: All backend functionalities are powered by AWS Lambda functions, ensuring a serverless and scalable architecture.
- **Security**: Managed via AWS Secrets Manager for credential security and dynamic retrieval.

üîí **Architectural Pillars:**

**Security:**
